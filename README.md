HTMLGenerator.cpp will read in two files and store them in a chart that will be printed using HTML when the output file is opened. 
The Socket programming will work if you open the server first, then the client. However you can only send and recieve if you send FROM the SERVER first. 
If you try to send from the client first it will get a connection lost error and I couldnt fix it. The program will allow the user to sendone message from the server
the go to the client and send one message back, afterwards both messages will be sent and viewable in the respective terminal.
